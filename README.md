# Software Engineering
Developing a non-monetary donation application for an NGO, divided into two milestones: requirements engineering and front-end design and development. In the first milestone, we meticulously analyzed stakeholder needs, defining actionable functional and non-functional requirements for both the web and mobile application. We ensured clarity and traceability in our documentation, emphasizing testability and scalability. In the second milestone, we focused on designing the web application's front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, adhering closely to UI/UX principles discussed in lectures. Our goal was to create an intuitive interface facilitating easy navigation and seamless user interaction. We conducted iterative design improvements based on feedback, optimizing for usability and responsiveness across devices. Throughout the project, we utilized GitHub for version control, fostering collaborative development and ensuring all members actively contributed to achieving our project goals.
